It houses the University \"Magna Gr\u00e6cia\", the second largest University of Calabria.\n\nCatanzaro is an urban center, with much activity, including some coastal towns, such as Sellia Marina and Soverato, and the municipalities of Silas, with a total of 156,196 inhabitants. Catanzaro is being consolidated to form a greater metropolitan area, by the Region of Calabria, and in connection with the town of Lamezia Terme, comprising 10 municipalities. This  will lead to the creation of an integrated area involving over 200,000 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the summer months, the Ionian coast from Catanzaro to [[Soverato]] is an important tourist attraction, especially for the youth, and is in the presence of several important structures located in the coastal districts of the city and the towns of Copanello and Soverato.\n\nCatanzaro is also known as city of the three V's, referring to the three distinct features of the city, namely Saint Vitalian, the patron saint; velvet, because the city has been an important silk center since [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine times]]; and wind ([[:wiktionary:vento|vento]] in Italian), because of the strong breezes from the [[Ionian Sea]] and [[La Sila]].\n\n\"VVV\" was the symbol by which Catanzaro's silk industry was known, identified for both its domestic and foreign markets, and iconic for the finest fabrication of silks, velvets, [[damask]]s, and brocades from the city."

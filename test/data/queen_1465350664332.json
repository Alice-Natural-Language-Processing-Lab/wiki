She is also Queen of 12 countries that have become independent since her accession: [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]].{{efn|name=list order|These countries are listed in the order of their original accession to the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book| last=Bartram| first=Graham| authorlink=Graham Bartram| year=2010| title=Flying Flags in the United Kingdom: A Guide to Britain's Flag Protocol| pages=15–16| url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Flying_Flags_in_the_United_Kingdom.pdf| format=pdf| publisher=Flag Institute| isbn=978-0-9513286-1-3}}</ref>}}\n\nElizabeth was born in London to the Duke and Duchess of York, later King [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and was the elder of their two daughters. She was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[Edward VIII]] in 1936, from which time she was the [[heir presumptive]]. She began to undertake public duties during [[World War II]], serving in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. In 1947, she married [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne]], [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]].\n\nElizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a [[Queen Elizabeth II's state visit to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] and reciprocal visits to and from the Pope.<!--NOTE:\"Pope\" refers to the Official role, not \"a pope\". She has met five popes.--> She has seen major constitutional changes, such as [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] in the United Kingdom, Canadian [[patriation]], and the [[decolonisation of Africa]]. She has also reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of [[States headed by Elizabeth II|her realms]]. She is the world's oldest reigning monarch as well as Britain's [[List of British monarchs by longevity|longest-lived]]. In 2015, she surpassed the reign of her great-great-grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]], to become the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning British monarch]] and the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning queen regnant]] in world history. She is currently also the third longest reigning monarch of any modern major European country. \n\nTimes of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, her [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation in 1953]], and the celebration of milestones such as her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]] and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond]] Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. Moments of sadness for her include the death of her father, aged 56; the assassination of Prince Philip's uncle, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]]; the breakdown of her children's marriages in 1992 (her ''[[Annus horribilis#Elizabeth II|annus horribilis]]''); the death in 1997 of her son's former wife, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]; and the deaths of her mother and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|sister]] in 2002. Elizabeth has occasionally faced [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]] sentiments and severe press criticism of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], but support for the monarchy and her personal popularity remain high.<!--e.g. Polls cited in \"Public perception and character\" section below: Ipsos MORI (2006 and 2012); Populus Ltd (2007); BBC (2007)-->"
